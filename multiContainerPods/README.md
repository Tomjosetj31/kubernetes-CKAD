# Multi Container Pods

## Design Patterns

### Sidecar

Deploying a logging service along with the main application container is a common use case in Kubernetes. This design pattern is known as the Sidecar pattern.

The Sidecar pattern involves running an additional container (the sidecar) alongside the main application container. The sidecar container is responsible for performing a specific task that complements the main application container.

In the case of logging, the sidecar container can be used to collect logs generated by the main application container and send them to a centralized logging system. This allows for better separation of concerns and enables the main application container to focus solely on its primary functionality.

To implement the Sidecar pattern, you can define a multi-container pod in your Kubernetes manifest file. The pod specification will include both the main application container and the sidecar container. Each container can have its own set of resources, such as CPU and memory limits, and can communicate with each other using inter-process communication mechanisms like shared volumes or network ports.

## Adapter

The Adapter pattern is another common design pattern used in Kubernetes to extend the functionality of an existing application without modifying its codebase. This pattern involves deploying an additional container (the adapter) alongside the main application container to provide additional features or services.

For example, you can use the Adapter pattern to add monitoring capabilities to an existing application by deploying a monitoring agent as a sidecar container. The monitoring agent can collect metrics and logs from the main application container and send them to a monitoring system for analysis.

## Ambassador

The Ambassador pattern is used to provide a proxy or gateway for an application running in a Kubernetes cluster. This pattern involves deploying an additional container (the ambassador) alongside the main application container to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate destination.

For example, you can use the Ambassador pattern to expose an internal service to the outside world by deploying an ambassador container that acts as a reverse proxy. The ambassador container can handle incoming requests, perform load balancing, and route traffic to the appropriate backend service.
